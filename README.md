# CS:GO FPS Config (+Launch Options)

This is a config (+launch options) for those who want more FPS in their CS:GO client

To install the config:
1. Download the autoexec.cfg on your pc
2. Place the config into your folder located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
3. Start up "Counter Strike: Global Offensive"

Launch Options for more FPS in CS:GO:

-tickrate 128 -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -high -limitvsconst -softparticlesdefaultoff -noaafonts -noubershader -nohltv -r_emulate_g +exec autoexec.cfg

How to use the launch options:

2. Right-click on "Counter Stike: Global Offensive" in your games list
3. Left-click Properties
4. Copy and paste the launch codes above
5. Leave the Properties

What the launch options do:

-tickrate 128 : sets the tickrate on your servers to "128" (highest tickrate on CS:GO)

-novid : disables the valve intro when you start up source games to save time and reduce slight load on the PC

-nojoy : disables joysticks for less startup time and memory usage

-nosteamcontroller : disables the steam controller for faster startup and less memory usage

-softparticlesdefaultoff : disables scene depth blending for particles and sprites; gives you more FPS

-high : sets the priority of the CS:GO client to "high" which makes the PC use more resources on the CS:GO client

-limitvsconst //will limit the game's number of vertex shaders to a maximum of 256, which can cause a FPS boost

-noaafonts //disables CS:GO's aafonts

-noubershader //disables csgo's ubershader that can cause performance issues

-nohltv //disables hltv in CS:GO

-r_emulate_g //will make CS:GO emulate OpenGL, which may offer a FPS boost

Enjoy!
